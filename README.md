<h1 align="center">Shopping List</h1>

## About

This is a simple Shopping List application.

## Objectives

- Practice Javascript.

## Learnings

- Created 'li' and 'xButton' elements by using Js function createElement(),
- This action is trigged when the 'Add Item" button is clicked.
- Created a textNode capturing the inputField.value and appended it to the 'li'.
- Created a class for 'xButton' and appended 'xButton' to the 'li'.
- Appended 'li' to the 'ul' so it is inserted dinamically into the HTML.
- A function 'buttonEvents' was created to load 'EventListeners" for the 'xButton" buttons. When this button is clicked, the parentElement.remove() removes the 'li' from the HTML.
- Then, this function was added to the 'createItemList' function which is triggered when the 'Add Item' button is clicked. Therefore, when the element is created, an event is also created for it.

## Languages/Technologies
